"**Example 1:** This command pulls the ``jupyter/scipy-notebook`` image "
"tagged ``17aba6048f44`` from Docker Hub if it is not already present on "
"the local host. It then starts a container running a Jupyter Notebook "
"server and exposes the server on host port 8888. The server logs appear "
"in the terminal. Visiting ``http://<hostname>:8888/?token=<token>`` in a "
"browser loads the Jupyter Notebook dashboard page, where ``hostname`` is "
